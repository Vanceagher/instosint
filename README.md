### An AI based Instagram OSINT tool

For this to work well you need your Instagram cookies, I use a Chrome extenbsion called [Export cookie JSON file for Puppeteer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BCjson%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E5%87%BA%E5%8A%9B-for-puppet/nmckokihipjgplolmcmjakknndddifde?hl=en)

Put the downloaded JSON file in your project directory and rename it to `cookies.json`

Set the username on line 23 and run `node index.js` or `node .` (CLI support coming soon)
